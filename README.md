#jquery.gallery.js
jquery.gallery.js is a "Cover Flow"-alike jQuery gallery plugin with graceful fallbacks for browsers that don't support CSS3.

##Usage
    $('.gallerycontainer').gallery();

##Notes
- Very closely follows the jQuery guide for authoring plugins.
- Example code is in index.html
- Currently only shown to work in WebKit nightlies and Safari 5.03 (Mac). Fallback code is still being written.

##Customization
Forthcoming...
